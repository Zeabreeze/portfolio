I went to the fruits and vegetables market this morning to get some fresh fruits.  I find the market is better than the supermarket.
The price at the market is cheaper than what sales in the supermarket.
I feel like having passionfruit and kiwi fruits.  I also want to make passionfruit cheesecake.
As I stroll through the stores in the market, I find banana and grapes are still expensive though considering they are plenty to buy at the fruits and vegetables market.
